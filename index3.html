<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Ryan Pagaduan. I graduated from Gahr High School in 2024 college at Cerritos College during the fall semester of that year after I applied through the Cerritos Complete Program. I am majoring in computer science and pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree. I saw this as the perfect major for my time here at college, because of my obsession with technology whether it be watching videos on YouTube or playing or learning to make video games. I look forward to learning about the importance of web pages across the internet.</p>
            
<h1>When I have free time</h1>
<ol>
<li>Play video games</li>
<li>Drawing aliens for my own personal story series</li>
<li>Hang out with friends and family at any place</li>

        </ol>

<p>My favorite website is
<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>
because it is a great place when searching for videos whether it be for educational or entertainment purposes.
